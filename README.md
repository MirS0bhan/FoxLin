# **_FoxLin_**
simple, fast, funny column based dbms on python

### philosophy
Foxlin developed to create the best User experience of DBMS interface for mini projects
it is fast because use of numpy array for contain columns data in memory
and using pydantic for manage data in program

also have powerfull process managers.

### Quick access :
 - [docs](https://GitHub.com/MisanoGo/FoxLin/blob/stable/docs)
 - pypi : [todo]()
 - [code](https://GitHub.com/MisanoGo/FoxLin)


### requirements
 * numpy
 * pydantic
 * orjson

## installation
```console
$ pip install foxlin
```

## simple usage :
```Python
from foxlin import FoxLin, Schema, Column, UniqeColumn

class MyTable(schema): 
    # define your teble schema
    # set your own column type needed, splited for low order and high performance
    name: str = Column()
    age: int = Column
    username: str = UniqeColumn()
    password: str = Column()

db = FoxLin('./db.json', MyTable) # create db

data = [
    MyTable(name='brian', age=37, username='biran1999', password='123456789')
    MyTable(name='sobhan', age=20, username='misano', password='#197382645#'),
    MyTable(name='Tommy', age=15, username='god_of_war', password='123QWEasdZXC')
    MyTable(name='Ali', age=20, username='p_1969_q', password='@QWE123KFH@')
]

with db.session as db_session:
    db_session.insert(*data)
    # auto commit after end of context manager


query = db.query
record = query.where(query.age > 17, query.name == Ali).order_by('age').first()

print(record.name, record.username, record.password)
```

## Story

Sophy was a curious girl, always looking to learn and explore new things. One day, she found herself surrounded by a dense forest, enchanted by the beauty and mystery it held.

As she walked further into the woods, she stumbled upon a Fox named Lin. Unlike other animals that would normally run away, Lin was as curious as Sophy was. Struck by their shared curiosity, they started talking.

Sophy soon realized that Lin was not just any fox but an intelligent fox with considerable knowledge in the world of data. Excited by this, Sophy began asking Lin questions, eager to learn as much as she could.

As they continued their conversation, they stumbled upon a huge database hidden in the forest that no one else had any idea about. Together, they navigated the vast expanse of knowledge within the database, reading and learning so many new things.

Sophy and Lin lost track of time, as they quenched their thirst for knowledge in this world of data.

As they walked back towards their homes, both of them were overcome with a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. They realized that the world was full of secrets waiting to be unraveled, and it was up to them to quench their thirst for knowledge and explore all the possibilities.

From that day on, Sophy and Lin would often visit the database and other places together, learning new things and exploring the world of data. They knew that knowledge had no limit and that there was always something new to discover, and it was this knowledge that would bring them closer every day.
